title: Unity dialogue editor and system
description: "Using Scriptable Objects and the NodeEditor API to make a designer-friendly dialogue system."

This is actually 2 projects in 1. 
The first is a dialogue system that uses scriptable objects to manage dialogue sequences as data.
The second is a Node Editor that can be used to create the afformentioned scriptable objects.

Having these 2 systems in place allows writers to design dialogue sequences intuitively and quickly.
I started making this tool after getting frustrated with the tediousness of storing all of my dialogue 
scripts inside .txt or JSON files that had to be imported into the Unity editor. It's not finished yet,
there's loads of features I want to add. But in the following weeks I will be documenting and polishing this tool 
as an experimental foray into the experimental Unity NodeAPI.
